The tests for Snippet1, Snippet 2, and Snippet 3 fail as shown by the text ```There were 3 failures:```, ```1) Snippet1(MarkdownParseTest)```, ```2) Snippet2(MarkdownParseTest)```, and ```3) Snippet3(MarkdownParseTest)``` in the terminal.

### Output When Running Test for Implementation Reviewed

![Image](ReviewGroup.png)

The tests for Snippet1 and Snippet2 fail as shown by the text ```There were 2 failures:```, ```1) Snippet1(MarkdownParseTest)```, and ```2) Snippet2(MarkdownParseTest)``` in the terminal. 

However, Snippet3 passes because it is not mentioned as a test case failure in the terminal. I also printed toReturn using ```System.out.println(toReturn); ``` before returning toReturn to see if the output for Snippet3's test actually matches the expected output and it does. I commented out all the other tests and only printed toReturn for Snippet3. It has the expected output by printing ```[https://www.twitter.com, https://ucsd-cse15l-w22.github.io/, https://cse.ucsd.edu/]```.

#### Answering Questions:
#### 1. Snippet 1
For snippet 1, I think that there could be a code change less 10 lines to get the expected output for just the first line of snippet 1 (````[a link`](url.com)```). For instance, a check for a backtick before the opening bracket could be implemented in the same if condition where we wrote a check for ```!```. However, in order to not recognize ```[`code]`](ucsd.edu)``` as a link, it may be more complicted than 10 lines because we have to implement code that recognizes which closing bracket to use when there are more than one closing brackets. In our code, we have a check to see if there is anything between the closing bracket and the first character after the opening paranthesis, in which case the line should not be considered a link. If we remove this statement, there would be an infinte loop but keeping the statment doesn't account for cases with multiple closing brackets, so finding a fix for this may be more than changing a few lines.

#### 2. Snippet 2
For snippet 2, I do not think there is a simple code fix that could work for nested parantheses because our code just checks for the first occurance of an open parantheses and the following occurance of an open parantheses, but it doesn't account for when there are parentheses between the opening and closing brackets. Accounting for this would mean recognizing the number of open parantheses and closing paranthesis and possibly using a stack to push in a open parantheses whenever one is found and pop that parantheses when a closing parentheses is found to identify the first and last paranthesis. This stack implementation would take more than 10 lines. The case with ```[some escaped \[ brackets \]](example.com)``` in code snippet 2 would not involve parantheses but would have a similar situation to snippet 1 with multiple closed brakcets, characters between the closing bracket and open paranthesis, and recognizing escaped brackets, which would also take many lines of code with the same reasoning as snippet 1 and possibly also using a stack in the same way as with parentheses but for brackets. This may also involve several conditional statments to account for instances of escaped brackets. 

#### 3. Snippet 3
For snippet 3, accounting for newlines in brackets and parantheses might take less than 10 lines for the first two links with ```https://www.twitter.com``` and ```https://ucsd-cse15l-w22.github.io/``` because ```.trim()``` could be used to remove any spaces before and after the links. However, for the last link ```https://cse.ucsd.edu/```, the text between the closing bracket and the actual opening parantheses that needs to be considered has a parantheses in it, so accounting for additional parantheses between the necessary open and closing brackets and open and closing parantheses may be more in depth and take more lines of code because the parantheses that actually encapsualte the link need to be recognized and the location of the actual link with ```https:``` would need to be recognized, but here could be many variations in hwow a link begins to recognize if it's actually a link.
