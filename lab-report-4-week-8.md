### Output When Running Test for Implementation Reviews

![Image](ReviewGroup.png)

The tests for Snippet1 and Snippet2 fail as shown by the text ```There were 2 failures:```, ```1) Snippet1(MarkdownParseTest)```, and ```2) Snippet2(MarkdownParseTest)``` in the terminal. 

However, Snippet3 passes because it is not mentioned as a test case failure in the terminal. I also printed toReturn using ```System.out.println(toReturn); ``` before returning toReturn to see if the output for Snippet3's test actually matches the expected output and it does. I commented out all the other tests and only printed toReturn for Snippet3. It has the expected output by printing ```[https://www.twitter.com, https://ucsd-cse15l-w22.github.io/, https://cse.ucsd.edu/]```.
